<div class="intro">
<p><span class="text emphasis">Scott Cawthon</span> was best known for Five Nights At Freddy's; a horror game that has been loved and played by many. It was based off of the RPG/role playing game Chipper and Sons Lumber Co. It began because many players said that the characters "moved and interacted with each other like animatronic machines." And instead of giving up, he used the characters to make the game we all know and love.</p>
<p>He made games in the FNAF (five Nights At Freddy's) franchise. But some things failed to be produced, like the FNAF Movie. it wasn't produced yet. He made eight games in this franchise and added spin offs too.</p>
